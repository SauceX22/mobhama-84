# SWE206 - Term Project
# KFUPM Research Center: Integrated Project and Resource Management System

## Problem Statement
Develop a comprehensive web-based application tailored for organizing group projects at the college level. The application will feature robust capabilities, including streamlined machine reservations, efficient project and team member assignments, and essential administrative functions for both administrators and team members. This solution aims to enhance communication, eliminate scheduling conflicts, and optimize the overall management of research projects within the institution.

## Project Backbone

### Non-Functional Requirement List

1. Application Environment: The software must be developed as a web-based application that is compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. 

2. Development languages: The software will be developed using Java as backend and JavaScript as frontend. All code should adhere to a consistent style guide for these languages. 

3. User-friendly interface: At least 90% of users should be able to navigate the system without assistance within their first hour of use. This can be measured through user testing. 

4. Reliability: The system should have a total downtime of at most 6 hours per year. This can be measured by monitoring the system over a period of time. 

5. Response time: The system should handle user requests and interactions within 2 seconds under normal load conditions. This can be measured using load testing tools. 

6. Memory usage: The system should use no more than 512MB of RAM under normal load conditions. This can be measured using performance monitoring tools. 

7. Authentication: The application must function with the existing authentication system. This can be confirmed through integration testing. 

8. Reservation time: The system should prevent reservations of a machine that exceeds one working day's worth of hours. This can be enforced through business rules in the system. 

9. Design theme: The application interface should follow the organizationâ€™s design theme. This can be confirmed through user acceptance testing. 

10. Documentation: The system must provide detailed documentation for users, administrators, and developers, covering system functions, procedures, and maintenance instructions. The completeness of the documentation can be evaluated by its full coverage of all aspects of the implemented software.
